#Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded - Decensor Patch/Mod

A lot of work and research has yet to be done, including proper reverse-engineering the CAFF version used by the game (for the scripts), decensoring them, synthesizing the missing (beeped) audio (using the official uncensored audio where possible), repacking the audio files.

For now, only a few decensored English scripts are included, as a proof of concept. These were manually decensored with a hex editor.
